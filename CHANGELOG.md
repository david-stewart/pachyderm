# Pachyderm Changelog

Changelog based on the [format here](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).

## [1.2.2] - 22 December 2018

### Added

- Enumeration YAML read and write mixins. They utilize the `__name__` of the enumeration (not the value!).
  See: `3f987afb`.

### Changed

- Allow for classes to be registered and constructed via YAML. See: `b877a09e`
- Allows for set of iterable values to be specified in a configuration file. Often used in conjunction
  with creating objects in YAML. See: `7cab0476`.

## [1.2.1] - 18 December 2018

### Changed

- Convert each argument via `str()` in the generic_config instead of `obj.str()` which is less portable and
  pythonic. Precipitated by changes in the definition of enumeration classes in the jet-hadron package. See:
  `595ef2a8`.

- Remove `pkgconfig` workaround introduced in `4a3c6216` since `python-lz4` merged in an alternative
  [approach](https://github.com/python-lz4/python-lz4/pull/160) to workaround the issue. See: `755c276a`.
