# Pachyderm Changelog

Changelog based on the [format here](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).

## [1.3.2] - 5 January 2019

### Changed

- `Histogram1D` now utilizes bin edges to define the axes instead of the bin centers. This allows for variable
  sized bins. Further, the bin centers (ie `x`) are easy to calculate from the bin edges, but the edges are
  a bit more painful. See: `b053fe8214591da6754e55d5f9dabf79a3cd5f56`.
- `Histogram1D` supports non-uniform binning. See: `32d2ed53f5743e0b8cab353130e045c733677255`.
- `get_array_from_hist2D(...)` can now return an (x, y) mesh using bin edges by enabling the
  `return_bin_edges` option. By default, it will use bin centers. See:
  `44a760a655eca0ec416042ec0a629cf88eb2ed7b`.

## [1.3.1] - 2 January 2019

### Added

- Improved test coverage to demonstrate why `deepcopy` is necessary when constructing objects. See:
  `369da022`.
- `histogram.get_histograms_in_file(filename)` to return all histograms stored in a ROOT file. See:
  `5b333884`.

### Changed

- Avoided a very expensive `deepcopy` by formatting strings into new objects instead of writing into existing
  objects (which had to be copied first). See: `085f8f18`.
- Return the iterables that were actually utilized in `generic_config.create_objects_from_iterables`. It
  replaces the iterables names return values with a dict, where the keys are the iterables names and the
  values are lists of the utilized iterables. See: `973b85ae`.

### Fixed

- `KeyIndex` already could be written to YAML - it didn't need `to_yaml` and `from_yaml` methods.

## [1.3] - 30 December 2018

### Added

- New YAML module to create YAML objects, register classes + modules for reading and writing, and additional
  helper functions. It generally encapsulate much of the basic YAML functionality. See: `e8009517`.
- Pre-commit hooks configuration to the repository based on `pre-commit`. This should generally improve the
  quality of commits. Currently includes `flake8`, `mypy`, `yamllint`, and some additional minor python
  checks. See: `586c1549` and `0510a0ba`.
- YAML linting via `yamllint`. Little is done with this yet, but more files should filter in, so it's useful
  to have . See: `a6bc250f`.

### Fixed

- Fixed breaking change made by `ruamel.yaml` upstream related to base python types receiving anchor support.
  It is a good start, but still needs some time to mature for our purposes. Also expanded the tests to check
  for such issues. See: `9aa7f4b7` (the commit message has far more information).
- Minor test improvements for `generic_config`. See: `d723bbcb`.

## [1.2.3] - 23 December 2018

### Fixed

- Mixin approach for enum values to/from YAML causes problems with pickling (which is implicitly called while
  copying). Revised the approach to be unbound functions, which doesn't have this same problem. See:
  `89159dc9`.

## [1.2.2] - 22 December 2018

### Added

- Enumeration YAML read and write mixins. They utilize the `__name__` of the enumeration (not the value!).
  See: `3f987afb`.

### Changed

- Allow for classes to be registered and constructed via YAML. See: `b877a09e`
- Allows for set of iterable values to be specified in a configuration file. Often used in conjunction
  with creating objects in YAML. See: `7cab0476`.

## [1.2.1] - 18 December 2018

### Changed

- Convert each argument via `str()` in the generic_config instead of `obj.str()` which is less portable and
  pythonic. Precipitated by changes in the definition of enumeration classes in the jet-hadron package. See:
  `595ef2a8`.

## [1.2] - 17 December 2018

### Added

- Include `--ignore-missing-includes` when running `mypy` automatically. See: `0ac7d0bd`.
- Full type annotations for the package. See: `a83372b1`.

### Changed

- Fully updated API naming scheme to follow python conventions. See: `cd097f3b`, `c7bedc6b`, `68048970`, and
  `7d8b1ca9`.
- Remove `pkgconfig` workaround introduced in `4a3c6216` since `python-lz4` merged in an alternative
  [approach](https://github.com/python-lz4/python-lz4/pull/160) to workaround the issue. See: `755c276a`.

## [1.1] - 15 December 2018

### Added

- Added `mypy` to Travis CI checks. See: `2c6f7dc0`.

### Changed

- Reworked iteration over analysis dictionaries. See: `0ead6db8`.
- Updated overwatch-base python version. See: `39fede7e`.

### Fixed

- Existing typing issues identified by `mypy`.

## [1.0] - 10 December 2018

### Added

- `Histogram1D` class moved from the `reaction_plane_fit` package to `pachyderm`. See: `89d2eaa3.`
- Added `uproot` dependency and add fix for `lz4` issue that is caused by ROOT. See: `89d2eaa3` and
  `4a3c6216`.
- version info is now available in the package by simply typing `import pachyderm; pachyderm.version_info`.
  See: `32ff4f96`.

### Changed

- Moved histogram functionality from `utils` to a new `histogram` module. This module also contains the added
  `Histogram1D` class (see above). See: `89d2eaa3`.

## [0.9] - 10 December 2018

- Initial release, with most of the development performed in
  [alice-yale-dev](https://github.com/ALICEYale/alice-yale-dev), and a bit in
  [alice-jet-hadron](https://github.com/raymondEhlers/alice-jet-hadron).
